# Flask Web Application Implementation Plan

*Generated on: 2025-03-02 09:45:12*

## Tasks

1. [ ] Set up a virtual environment using venv or conda
2. [ ] Install Flask and required dependencies: Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-WTF
3. [ ] Create the project structure following Flask best practices
4. [ ] Define database models for User, Post, and Comment
5. [ ] Implement user authentication with secure password hashing
6. [ ] Create RESTful API endpoints for resources
7. [ ] Design frontend templates using Jinja2 and Bootstrap
8. [ ] Add form validation and CSRF protection
9. [ ] Implement error handling and logging
10. [ ] Write unit and integration tests
11. [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
12. [ ] Configure production deployment on Heroku or similar platform

## Implementation Details

The application should follow the MVC pattern with clear separation of concerns. The database will use SQLAlchemy ORM for interacting with either SQLite (development) or PostgreSQL (production).

Authentication will be handled using Flask-Login with password hashing via Werkzeug security utilities. All forms will be created with Flask-WTF to ensure proper validation and CSRF protection.

Frontend will use Bootstrap 5 for responsive design, with modular templates using Jinja2 inheritance.

API endpoints will return JSON responses and follow RESTful conventions, with proper HTTP status codes and error messages.

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Review the plan with the team to ensure alignment with requirements
2. [ ] Set up the initial repository with README and .gitignore
3. [ ] Create a requirements.txt file with pinned dependencies
4. [ ] Schedule daily check-ins to track progress and address blockers
